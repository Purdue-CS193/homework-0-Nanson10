### Nanson Chen's First CS193 Homework

Link to [website](https://purdue-cs193.github.io/homework-0-Nanson10/):

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Homework

My favorite things about CS193!
- The Lecturers
- My classmates
- Crashing out on GitHub
- Contributing absolutely nothing to the coding community
- Hating on C because strlen can read off into infinity with no null terminator (This is why Java Strings are better)
- Smashing my head on my keyboard when learning Rust as it is a **GREAT AND WONDERFUL IDEA** to learn Rust as your first low-level programming language (I really ate up all that memory safety and performance hype)
- Learning how to write a terminal command that can delete all the files in a Linux OS (The computer is like "f**k it we ball").
- Being more enjoyable than abysmally boring CS180 BK **BECAUSE I SPENT 2 YEARS OF CS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND GOT A 5 ON THE AP CS A EXAM THAT DIDN'T COUNT FOR JACK**
- The easy quizzes
- The free whatever GitHub Student Backpack thingy is

What a day to be some **bold** text am I right, _Italic_?

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
